This project is to test GitHub in terms of reading local Git commit history before a remote is created.

Before even making any changes to files in the local repository managed by Git, shall we create a remote repository
in GitHub and corresponds it with the local repository? 

With that, all version information would be well captured by GitHub as well as Git, right?

Hmm, what if we make some commits to a local repository with Git and then create a remote repository in GitHub and
and push the local repository to the remote repository, ie. the first push to the repository in GitHub.

Would we be able to see the history of all the past commits done locally with Git?

Let's see ... 

Now, head to GitHub and create a remote repository to check this out:-)
