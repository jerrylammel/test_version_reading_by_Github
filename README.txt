This project is to test GitHub in terms of reading local Git commit history before a remote is created.

Before even making any changes to files in the local repository managed by Git, shall we create a remote repository
in GitHub and corresponds it with the local repository? 

With that, all version information would be well captured by GitHub as well as Git, right?
